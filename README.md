# Hyrule [for Github Atom]

Hyrule from SublimeText ported to Atom.

A pair dynamic greens along with a soothing orange, and an addictive yellow make up the main palette of Hyrule. Well-chosen background and primary text colors leave a developer's eyes fit for another day of study. Works very well in `Java`, `Go`, `JavaScript`, and `HTML`.

Some colors have been remaped to be more similar to the 2014 version of Hyrule.
